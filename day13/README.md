# Day 13

[Here's the problem.](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/13)

## Running It

```
$ ./day13 part1 example_input.txt
24
```

```
$ ./day13 part2 example_input.txt
10
```

## Notes

I came up with a clean description of how to solve the first part. The
second part ... well, that's just a brute force application of the
first part.
