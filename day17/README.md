# Day 17

[Here's the problem.](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/17)

## Running It

```
$ ./day17 part1 343
1914
```

```
$ ./day17 part2 343
41797835
```

## Notes

I did this with a circular linked list. It took may 10 minutes to run
the second part. I spent that time thinking of how I would optimize it
if I got the wrong answer. But I got the right answer, so hey, never
mind
